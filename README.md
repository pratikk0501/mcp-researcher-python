# mcp-researcher-python
* This project is titled 'MCP-powered Deep Researcher' where an AI agent is built to be a 100% local alternative to ChatGPT's deep research feature.
# Project Description
* Implemented multi-agent orchestration using CrewAI, coordinating web search, result verification, and content generation agents.
* Integrated Linkup for deep web research to retrieve comprehensive and relevant information efficiently.
* Deployed Ollama to serve DeepSeek-R1 locally, ensuring fast and private inference for research queries.
* Designed a research pipeline where results are deduplicated and verified by an automated analyst before generating a coherent, citation-rich report.
* Utilized Cursor as MCP host to streamline agent communication and manage the local AI workflow.
